# Cataloging Overview
</center>
<hr size=2>

When we talk about the "Cataloging" portion of Evergreen, we are talking primarily about the features that roughly correspond to the options available on the "Cataloging" menu option of the staff client.

When you go to the "Cataloging" section in the top menu of Evergreen, this is what you're looking at:

##Search the Catalog
There are multiple ways to access this screen throughout Evergreen. One of the most commong ways is either through the main landing page when you open the staff client:

![Splash](/images/cat_search_the_catalog_splash.png)

When searching where the arrow points, you're perfoming a generic keyword search. Clicking on the "Search the Catalog" button or selection from the Cataloging menu will place you in the Advanced search landing page.

![Button](/images/cat_search_the_catalog1.png)

Clicking on the arrow to the right of the "Search the Catalog" button will also allow you to perfom TCN/Database ID searches which are described below. You can also reach these through the Cataloging dropdown menu.

![After Click](/images/cat_search_the_catalog2.png)

Once you click on the "Search the Catalog" button or select it from the drop down, this is the screen you are presented with. This is essentially the Advanced Search Screen. You have options to search by Numeric values (ISBN/ISSN/Call Number/LCCN/TCN/Item Barcode) or an "Expert" search which allows you to search within fields and subfields or MARC records. Be sure to leave the "Search Library" set to the top level "Sage Library Consortium" if you are using this option.

##Retrieve title by TCN
![TCN](/images/cat_retrieve_title_tcn.png)

This is for searching at the Bibliographic record level. TCN stands for Title Control Number and is located in the upper, brief information section when opening a record within the staff client.

These two numbers are important for enabling quick location and editing of MARC records within Evergreen. If you have questions about a certain MARC/Bibliographic record, mentioning the TCN/DB ID to Beth or Brent is extremely helpful in locating information about it.

##Retrieve title by Database ID
![DB ID](/images/cat_retrieve_title_dbid.png)

This is where you would enter the Bibliographic record's database ID to retrieve a single title.

##Display Item
![Display Item](/images/cat_display_item.png)

Choosing the "Display Item" option simply brings up the versitile "Item Status" screen. Here you can see item information as well as edit.

##Manage Copy Buckets
![Copy Buckets](/images/cat_manage_copy_buckets.png)

Copy Buckets can be very useful when editing a large collection of barcoded items that you can't do in one session. Or, if you'd like to share your batch of "to be edited" items with another staff member.

When you first choose this option, you will need to create a bucket for yourself by selecting "New Bucket". This interface is great for doing batch requests on items, batch edits on attributes (Shelving Location, Copy Status, Price)
##Manage Record Buckets

##Retrieve Last Record
If you accidentally closed the tab of a record you were looking at or editing, this option will bring that screen back.

##Manage Authorities
This is a Cat1 menu.

##Link Checker
This is not used within Sage.
