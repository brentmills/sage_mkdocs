##How to Contribute

Would you like to contribute or feel that the documentation could be improved or built upon?

The source files used for building the repository are in:

- [https://github.com/brentmills/sage_mkdocs](https://github.com/brentmills/sage_mkdocs)

And a live preview site is available at:

- [http://brentmills.github.io](http://brentmills.github.io)

This will change as we move along. I chose the Markdown syntax because it's relatively easy to write and the learning curve is minimal. Basically, write a document how you normally would.

Suggestions and attachements can also be sent to [my email address](brent@hoodriverlibrary.org).

Thanks!
